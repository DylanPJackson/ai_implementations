Types of Implementations
=======
This repo will contain two main types of implementations. Low level, and high
level. Low level being ones that are mainly written using numpy, cupy, scipy,
or any other math/computation based library. The higher level ones may be 
written in tensorflow, pytorch, or any other higher level framework / library.

The purpose of the low level implementations is to demonstrate my own
understanding of those concepts at the mathematical level. My other repo,
ml-coursera-python-assignments, contains similar low level implementations.
But those implementations were all guided by the course, and as such the 
overall structure of the code and data are not my own. Thus these implementations
aim to demonstrate for my own sake that I can, 
1. Implement foundational AI concepts and algorithms from start to finish 
2. Gather or construct a data set to solve a problem or identify some trend
---
The purpose of the higher level implentations is to demonstrate my fluency
with current industry standard technologies in this area. 

With both of these sorts of implementations I hope to demonstrate that I can 
create robust models and analytical tools and that I truly understand the math 
behind them.
